                            <p>For 8800 and 8850 Sureshotgps have membership options so you, the customer, can customise your GPS to your needs. The Lifetime membership ensures you never have to pay annual fees with a one off fee of $49.95 which gives you access to our worldwide map database for the entire life of the product. Other membership options have renewal fees however you can choose not to renew and still keep your favourite courses on your Sureshotgps forever. Renewing your membership means you can continue to access to the worldwide map database and interchange your course downloads. Micro, SS8850X & SS9000X V2.0 come with a FREE Lifetime Membership so there are no annual fees, ever.</p>

                            <p>The Sureshotgps™ has been designed specifically for the golfer and is therefore simple in its operation. There are multiple levels of operation and the player decides on the level required. The simplest level gives distances to the pin or recorded hazards and requires the press of one button at the start of each hole. If more information is required or recorded then the player can choose a higher level of operation and this can require the pressing of additional easy to use function keys. Whatever level is chosen, operation is easy.</p>

                            <p>We first started mapping courses early 2006. Currently we have over 14,000+ courses available. Everyday new golfers are adding their player mapped courses. Sureshotgps™ is forever continually mapping golf courses around the world.</p>

                            <h6>Will the Sureshotgps™ work with a Mac computer ?</h6>
                            <p>The Sureshotgps Original model is Mac compatible under OS X running Parallels Desktop for Mac Release Candidate (Build 3120). The Sureshotgps 8800, 8850 and micro models are Mac compatible with SureAnalysis Version 3. Background Parallels Desktop for Mac is the first solution for Intel-Macs that give you the flexibility of running Windows on Mac OS X simultaneously without rebooting. It accomplishes this by allowing a user to run a Virtual machine (Guest OS) inside a windowed environment inside the Parent OS. The Sureanalysis™ Software application for the Sureshotgps™ functions properly in this environment. Please note its only supported under Windows XP. However we have many MAC customers using this environment.</p>

                            <h6>Can I use the Sureshotgps™ with other applications ?</h6>
                            <p>Yes, the serial USB port on Sureshotgps™ is normally used for communicating with Sureanalysis™ and our PC application used to upload / download courses to Sureshotgps™. Communication between Sureanalysis™ and Sureshotgps™ uses a proprietary serial protocol. NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) is a standard for communicating with GPS receivers that uses a simple ASCII serial communications protocol to defines how data is transmitted in a 'sentence' from one 'talker' to one or more 'listeners'. The standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type so that all listeners can parse messages accurately. We have included NMEA capability for users who may wish to interface Sureshotgps™ to other PC applications using NMEA such as Fugawi. Sureshotgps™ can only use one protocol at a time on the serial port, so if you enable NMEA you will be unable to talk to Sureanalysis™ until you change the setting back. We recommend you don't touch this setting unless you have a special need to use NMEA output.</p>

                            <h6>How does the Sureshotgps™ know my average driving distance?</h6>
                            <p>Most Sureshotgps™ models can keep a record of your average driving distance for up to 14 clubs. The Original model can then use this distance to make club recommendations during normal play if this feature is enabled under the Features / Clubs / Enable clubs menu. The 8800 model can still record the distance of each club, however the Club Recommendations option has been removed. There are two ways in which you can teach Sureshotgps™ what your average driving distance is for each club. 1) Measure your drive and calibrate on Sureshotgps™ 8800 or 8850. To use this feature, select the Features / Clubs / Measure Clubs option. You will be asked the club you wish to calibrate and can use the left and right arrows to cycle through the various clubs. When your selected club is shown press the left soft key (marked 'Select') and follow the instructions to record the initial ball position, make your shot and record the final ball position. The distance struck will be shown and you can use the centre soft key (marked 'Save') to record this inside Sureshotgps™. You can repeat this procedure for all other clubs by using the arrow keys to select the each successive club and following the calibration procedure. As you calibrate each club the data is automatically stored inside Sureshotgps™. 2) When using the original model, you can enter the distances in the Windows software provided 'Sureanalysis™' and download them to Sureshotgps™. This is the easiest option if you know pretty well what distances you can strike with each club and don't need to measure them on the golf course. Connect Sureshotgps™ to Sureanlysis™ as normal and press the User Setup button. On the right side of the screen you will see a table that allows you to type in distances for up to 14 clubs. Sureanalysis™ can even estimate your club distances and populate each club with distances struck by an average golfer. </p>

                            <p>When we designed the Sureshotgps™, we knew that it would take a while before we could have all the courses mapped that our customers would require. As you can appreciate, there are thousands of courses around the world and getting them mapped and on the database as quickly as we would like is a challenge. Knowing this we designed the Sureshotgps™ with a simple to use mapping capability a course can be mapped while it is being played or simply by walking to the course prior to a round and mapping the required coordinates. Mapping with the Sureshotgps™ allows the golfer to map not only the front, rear and centre of the green but also up to 15 hazards and a lay up position for each hole. We appreciate that you would prefer to be able to download a course from the database. If you would provide us with the details of the course you require, we will endeavour to get it mapped and on the database as soon as possible. In the meantime, we hope that you are able to map your course with the Sureshotgps™ and begin to enjoy the benefits of playing with the Sureshotgps™. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require further assistance with course mapping or any other aspect of the Sureshotgps™.

                            <p>The Sureshotgps™ uses a battery gauge chip that learns the battery capacity over time as the device is used. To get the best results we recommend the following: 1) Turn Sureshotgps™ off and charge overnight. 2) Use as normal until the battery is completely flat. 3) Recharge. This charge / discharge cycle should allow the device to calibrate itself against the battery and display an accurate indication. The Sureshotgps 8800 and 8850 models display a charging light when the unit is on the off mode. The bottom left hand green key under the screen will flash when the unit is successfully charging.</p>

Under normal operating conditions (for example, playing a round of golf) the battery life would typically be 7+ hours. The Sureshotgps 8800 and 8850 models will allow over 18 hole play in one day between charges.</p>

                            <p>Yes. There have been major advances in LCD technology, which now enable LCDs to be used in direct sunlight. The display used in the Sureshotgps™ has been optimised to give the best possible results under all conditions. There is a big difference between the display used in Sureshotgps™ and those used in PDAs and laptops.

                            <p>GPS accuracy is affected by a number of factors, including satellite positions, noise in the radio signal, atmospheric conditions, and natural barriers to the signal. Noise can create an error between 10 to 15 meters and results from static or interference from something near the receiver or something on the same frequency. The most accurate determination of position occurs when the satellite and receiver have a clear view of each other and no other objects interfere.</p>
