We comply with the National Privacy Principals (NPPs) as implemented under the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 ('Privacy Act'), which came into effect on 21 December 2001. The Privacy Act established a national scheme for the handling of personal information by private sector organisations. The NPPs are the minimum privacy standards.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how SureShotGPS safeguards the privacy of your personal information in compliance with the privacy laws. The scope of the principles set out in our Privacy Policy extends to any personal information you give to us in person, through the telephone, via our website or pursuant to any other arrangement. Acts and practices of ours which are directly related to the employee records of our current and former employees are exempt from the coverage of the NPPs and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them.</p>
                    <h6>Our Commitment to Protecting Your Privacy</h6>
                    <p>Meaning of Personal Information means any information or opinion about you from which your identity is apparent or can reasonably be established.</p>
                    <h6>Collection of your Personal Information</h6>

                    <h6>Securing your Personal Information</h6>
